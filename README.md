This is a simple one page, about me website. If you are, like me, new to web development, you should have no problems understanding code. If not, let me know.

### I used
* Simple HTML structure: main | aside | sections | list 
* very basic CSS: floats | media querries | ems
* one short JavaScript script: user prompt | alert message

#### inspiration:
Ikea color palette and Lighthouse Labs HTML500 event
